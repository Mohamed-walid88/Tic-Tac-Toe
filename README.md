# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Web Version)

A modern browser-based Tic Tac Toe game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This project is a web adaptation of a Java-based Tic Tac Toe engine, including an AI powered by the **Minimax algorithm** with multiple difficulty levels.

## 🧠 How the AI Works

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a recursive decision-making algorithm used in two-player games.

- The AI simulates all possible moves.
- It evaluates board states:
  - +1 → AI win
  - -1 → Player win
  - 0 → Draw
- It selects the move that maximizes its chance of winning.

On **Hard difficulty**, the AI is mathematically unbeatable.
